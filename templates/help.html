# Video Call Landing Page

This small app creates a landing page that participants can be sent
through prior to joining a video call, relaying important info.

Useful for:

- Making a dislaimer about call recording.
- Other things?

### Supported Platforms

- Anything!




## Usage

Enter the URL of this page (eg.
`https://event-metadata-parser.herokuapp.com/`) followed by the event source
URL (with no spaces in-between) to extract the event data.

For example, for the event URL at
`https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/women-win-to-2018-launch-tickets-34703027690`
the corresponding parsed data URL is
`https://event-metadata-parser.herokuapp.com/https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/women-win-to-2018-launch-tickets-34703027690`
â€” you can view it in browser.
