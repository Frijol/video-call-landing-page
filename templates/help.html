# Video Call Landing Page

This small app creates a landing page that participants can be sent
through prior to joining a video call, relaying important info.

Useful for:

- Making a dislaimer about call recording.
- Other things?

### Supported Platforms

- Zoom Meetings
- Other platforms easily supported by changing text instructions!

## Usage

For setting up a Zoom Meeting with proper configuration [click
here](https://hackmd.io/JwQwbAJgRgxrC0AORBGY8AswIyQUxHRAFYBmPAdmJhRgCZsg?view).

(The following assumes you have a video call URL from that proces above.)

Enter the URL of this page (eg.
`https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/`) followed by the video call
URL (with no spaces in-between) to generate a landing page.

For example, for the video call URL at
`https://zoom.us/j/508236833`
the corresponding landing page URL is
`https://edgi-video-call-landing-page.herokuapp.com/https://zoom.us/j/508236833`
â€” you can view it in browser.
